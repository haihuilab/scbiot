The notebooks showcase end-to-end workflows for preprocessing, model training,
and evaluation across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and multi-omics data. They mirror
the Scanpy/Read the Docs layout with short landing pages, clear menus, and
runnable code snippets. All notebooks live in ``examples/`` and can be opened
locally or in any Jupyter environment.
