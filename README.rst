scBIOT
======

scBIOT (Single-Cell Biological Insights via Optimal Transport and Omics Transformers) 
is a lightweight Python library that streamlines the preprocessing and embedding 
workflows we routinely use for RNA, ATAC, and joint multi-omics datasets. 
It emphasizes reproducible data preparation, interpretable latent embeddings, 
and compact, user-friendly APIs that run out of the box on real AnnData data.
