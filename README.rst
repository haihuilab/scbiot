scBIOT
======

**scBIOT** is a lightweight Python library for single-cell omics integration. 
It bundles the preprocessing and embedding workflows we routinely apply to RNA, ATAC, 
and joint multi-omics datasets. The library emphasizes reproducible data preparation, 
single-cell clustering using embeddings derived from optimal transport and Transformer-based VAEs, 
and concise APIs that work out of the box on AnnData data.
