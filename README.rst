scBIOT
======

scBIOT (Single-Cell Biological Insights via Optimal Transport and Omics Transformers) offers a
reproducible preprocessing + embedding workflow for RNA, ATAC, and paired
multi-omic datasets. The library wraps normalisation, log transforms, highly
variable gene selection, dimensionality reduction, and clustering behind a
single ``ScBIOT`` class.
