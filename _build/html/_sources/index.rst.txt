scBIOT documentation
====================

**scBIOT** (Single-Cell Biological Insights via Optimal Transport and Omics Transformers) unifies optimal-transport alignment with Transformer encoders for preprocessing and embedding single-cell RNA, ATAC, and multi-omic data. The library is designed for reproducible benchmarking and scalable inference across modalities.

Highlights
----------

* Single-cell integration with optimal transport (OT): high NMI and ARI  with biological preservation.
* Unified model Transformer base VAE: trains on batch corrected OT space and fast inference with high batch mixing and biological preservation.
* Supports scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, paired and unpaired multi-omics.
* Inspectable latent components plus single-cell clustering.
