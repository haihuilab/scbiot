API
===

scBIOT exposes a lightweight surface API today. Full, auto-generated API docs
will be added once the public classes stabilise. For now, the two key areas are:

* ``scbiot.ot`` — optimal-transport utilities for co-embedding and integration.
* ``scbiot.models`` — variational autoencoders used in the tutorials
  (:mod:`scbiot.models.vae`).

See the tutorial pages for end-to-end usage examples with ``scb.ot.integrate``
and ``scb.models.vae(...)``. If you prefer docstrings in your IDE, you can
inspect them directly in the source tree under ``src/scbiot/``.
